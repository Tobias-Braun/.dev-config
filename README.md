# .dev-config
dev config for zsh and maybe later other dev stuff


# How to use

- If you're on windows install linux subsystem for windows
- Install Zsh
- Install .oh-my-zsh
- remove config files and folders (.zshrc, .bshrc, .oh-my-zsh, .zsh)
- pull in .dev-config in your ~ dir
- create symbolic links to .zshrc, .bshrc, .oh-my-zsh, .zsh) (use ln -s <path-in-dev-config> <path-in-home> for that)
- NOTE: you need to install nerd fonts for the glyphs to display correctly  
enjoy a synced shell configuration.
